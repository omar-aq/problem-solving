# Question 1 : Time Conversion.

```sh
Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to 10<sup>-4</sup> are acceptable.
```

### Examples:

```sh
s="12:01:00PM" return "12:01:00"
s="12:01:00AM" return "00:01:00"
```

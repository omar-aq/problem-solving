# Question 1 : Your order, please.

```sh
our task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.
```

### Examples:

```sh
"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a" --> "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2" --> "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
"" --> ""
```

# Question 2 : Persistent Bugger.

```sh
Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.
```

### For example (Input --> Output):

```sh
39 --> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit)
999 --> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2)
4 --> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number)
```

# Question 3 : Playing with digits.

```sh
Some numbers have funny properties. For example:

89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1

695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p

we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such that the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n.
In other words:

Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k

If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.

Note: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.
```

### Example (Input --> Output):

```sh
digPow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1
digPow(92, 1) should return -1 since there is no k such as 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k
digPow(695, 2) should return 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
digPow(46288, 3) should return 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51
```

# Question 4 :Is a number prime?

```sh
Define a function that takes an integer argument and returns a logical value true or false depending on if the integer is a prime.

Per Wikipedia, a prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Requirements
You can assume you will be given an integer input.
You can not assume that the integer will be only positive. You may be given negative numbers as well ( or 0 ).
NOTE on performance: There are no fancy optimizations required, but still the most trivial solutions might time out. Numbers go up to 2^31 ( or similar, depending on language ). Looping all the way up to n, or n/2, will be too slow.
```

### Example (Input --> Output):

```sh
is_prime(1)  /* false */
is_prime(2)  /* true  */
is_prime(-1) /* false */
```

# Question 5 :Credit Card Mask

```sh
Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.
```

### Example (Input --> Output):

```sh
"4556364607935616" --> "############5616"
     "64607935616" -->      "#######5616"
               "1" -->                "1"
                "" -->                 ""

// "What was the name of your first pet?"

"Skippy" --> "##ippy"

"Nananananananananananananananana Batman!"
-->
"####################################man!"
```

# Question 6 :Is a number prime?

```sh
Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
```

### Example (Input --> Output):

```sh
Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case
```

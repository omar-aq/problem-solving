# Question 1 : Plus Minus.

```sh
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to 10<sup>-4</sup> are acceptable.
```

### Examples:

```sh
arr=[1,1,0,-1,-1] --> 0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
```
